Hello world
How to go to home directory: re member home is the special character called "tilda" `~`
`cd ~`

What is in my home directory?
`ls -la`

Where am I on the tree of the filesystem? 
`pwd`

### Exercise:
Let's create a user "micky" and a user "mouse". 
To accomplish this, you need to have elevated privileges, and thus must be run as a root user or with a `sudo`
Run: 
`sudo adduser micky` set password `ILoveMicky13!` . Do you think this is a strong password? How would you improve it?

Next, let's use the original `useradd` command.
